User Preferences
================

There are only a few options located in the Preferences, accessible
though the menu via *Edit > Preferences*. Most other options, like
whether to draw the grid, what kind of snapping to do or the last used
settings when creating a new map are simply remembered persistently.

The preferences are stored in a system-dependent format and location:

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Windows** | Registry key ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\mapeditor.org\Tiled`` |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **macOS**   | :file:`~/Library/Preferences/org.mapeditor.Tiled.plist`         |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Linux**   | :file:`~/.config/mapeditor.org/tiled.conf`                      |

Saving and Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reload tileset images when they change
    This is very useful while working on the tiles or when the tiles
    might change as a result of a source control system.

Restore previous session on startup
    When disabled, Tiled always starts with an empty session. This can be
    useful when you frequently switch projects.

Use safe writing of files
    This setting causes files to be written to a temporary file, and
    when all went well, to be swapped with the target file. This avoids
    data getting lost due to errors while saving or due to insufficient
    disk space. Unfortunately, it is known to cause issues when saving
    files to a Dropbox folder or a network drive, in which case it helps
    to disable this feature.

Repeat last export on save
    With this feature enabled, any time you save a map or tileset that was
    previously exported it will automatically be exported again to the same
    location and format.

.. _export-options:

Export Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following export options are applied each time a map or tileset gets
exported, without affecting the map or tileset itself.

Embed tilesets
    All tilesets are embedded in the exported map. Useful for example
    when you are exporting to JSON and loading an external tileset is
    not desired.

Detach templates
    All template instances are detached. Useful when you want to use the
    templates feature but can't or don't want to load the external
    template object files.

Resolve object types and properties
    Stores effective object type and properties with each object.
    Object properties are inherited from a tile (in case of a tile
    object) and from the default properties of their type.

Minimize output
    Omits unnecessary whitespace in the output file. This option is supported
    for XML (TMX and TSX), JSON and Lua formats.

These options are also available as options when exporting using the
command-line.

Interface
---------

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

Language
    By default the language tries to match that of the system, but if it
    picks the wrong one you can change it here.

Grid colour
    Because black is not always the best color for the grid.

Fine grid divisions
    The tile grid can be divided further using this setting, which
    affects the "Snap to Fine Grid" setting in the *View > Snapping*
    menu.

Object line width
    Shapes are by default rendered with a 2 pixel wide line, but some
    people like it thinner or even thicker. On some systems the DPI-based
    scaling will affect this setting as well.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.5</div>

Object selection behavior
    By default the :ref:`select-objects-tool` tool selects objects from any
    layer. With this setting, you can make it prefer to select objects from the
    currently selected layers, or to only pick objects from the selected
    layers.

    When the "Highlight Current Layer" option is enabled, Tiled automatically
    prefers to select objects from the currently selected layers.

Hardware accelerated drawing (OpenGL)
    This enables a rather unoptimized way of rendering the map using
    OpenGL. It's usually not an improvement and may lead to crashes, but
    in some scenarios it can make editing more responsive.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.1</div>

Mouse wheel zooms by default
    This option causes the mouse wheel to zoom without the need to hold
    Control (or Command on macOS). It can be a convenient way to
    navigate the map, but it can also interfere with panning on a
    touchpad.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.5</div>

Middle mouse button uses auto-scrolling
    With this option enabled, the clicking middle mouse button doesn't drag the
    map directly but instead controls the speed of a continuous panning
    movement.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.5</div>

Use smooth scrolling
    This option affects the behavior when scrolling with the arrow keys. When
    disabled, the view scrolls in steps based on key press events. When enabled
    (the default), the view scrolls continuously while the keys are held down.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.3</div>

Updates
~~~~~~~

By default, Tiled checks for news and new versions and highlights any updates
in the status bar. Here you can disable this functionality. It is recommended
to keep at least one of these enabled.

If you disable displaying of new versions, you can still manually check
whether a new version is available by opening the *About Tiled* dialog.

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.3</div>

.. _keyboard-options:

Keyboard
--------

Here you can add, remove or change the keyboard shortcuts of most available
actions.

Conflicting keybindings are highlighted in red. They will not work until you
resolve the conflict.

If you customize multiple shortcuts, it is recommended to use the export
functionality to save the keybindings somewhere, so that you can easily
recover that setup or copy it to other Tiled installations.


Theme
-----

On Windows and Linux, the default style used by Tiled is "Tiled Fusion".
This is a customized version of the "Fusion" style that ships with Qt.
On macOS, this style can also be used, but because it looks so out of
place the default is "Native" there.

The "Tiled Fusion" style allows customizing the base color. When
choosing a dark base color, the text automatically switches to white and
some other adjustments are made to keep things readable. You can also
choose a custom selection color.

The "Native" style tries to fit in with the operating system, and is
available since it is in some cases preferable to the custom style. The
base color and selection color can't be changed when using this style,
as they depend on the system.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new">New in Tiled 1.10</div>

Custom Interface Font
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally the application font defaults to the one defined by the system. If
you'd like Tiled to use a different font, you can set one here.

Plugins
-------

Here you can choose which plugins are enabled, as well as opening the
:doc:`scripted extensions </reference/scripting>` folder.

Plugins add support for map and/or tileset file formats. Some generic plugins
are enabled by default, while more specific ones need to be manually enabled.

There is no need to restart Tiled when enabling or disabling plugins.
When a plugin fails to load, try hovering its icon to see if the tool
tip displays a useful error message.

See :doc:`export` for more information about supported file formats.
