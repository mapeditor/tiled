 *
 * Properties usually will have related signals which can be used to detect
 * changes to that property, but most of those are currently not implemented.
 *
 * To connect to a signal, call its {@link Signal.connect | connect} function and
 * pass in a function object. In the following example, newly created maps

 *
 * ```js
 * tiled.assetCreated.connect(function(asset) {

 *         tiled.log("assetCreated: Removed automatically added tile layer.")
 *     }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * In some cases it will be necessary to later disconnect the function from
 * the signal again. This can be done by defining the function separately
 * and passing it into the {@link Signal.disconnect | disconnect} function:
 *
 * ```js
 * function onAssetCreated(asset) {

 *
 * tiled.assetCreated.connect(onAssetCreated)

   * If a map format is already registered with the same `shortName`, the
   * existing format is replaced. The short name can also be used to
   * specify the format when using `--export-map` on the command-line, in
   * case the file extension is ambiguous or a different one should be
   * used.
   *
   * @example
   * Example that produces a simple JSON representation of a map:
   * ```js
   * var customMapFormat = {
   *     name: "Custom map format",
   *     extension: "custom",
   *
   *     write: function(map, fileName) {
   *         var m = {
   *             width: map.width,
   *             height: map.height,
   *             layers: []
   *         };
   *
   *         for (var i = 0; i < map.layerCount; ++i) {
   *             var layer = map.layerAt(i);
   *             if (layer.isTileLayer) {
   *                 var rows = [];
   *                 for (y = 0; y < layer.height; ++y) {
   *                     var row = [];
   *                     for (x = 0; x < layer.width; ++x)
   *                         row.push(layer.cellAt(x, y).tileId);
   *                     rows.push(row);
   *                 }
   *                 m.layers.push(rows);
   *             }
   *         }
   *
   *         var file = new TextFile(fileName, TextFile.WriteOnly);
   *         file.write(JSON.stringify(m));
   *         file.commit();
   *     },
   * }
   *
