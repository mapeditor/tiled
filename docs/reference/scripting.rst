Scripting
=========

Introduction
------------

Tiled can be extended with the use of JavaScript. Scripts can be used to
implement :ref:`custom map formats <script-registerMapFormat>`,
:ref:`custom actions <script-registerAction>` and :ref:`new tools <script-registerTool>`.
Scripts can also :ref:`automate actions based on signals <script-connecting-to-signals>`.

On startup, Tiled will execute any script files present in
:ref:`extensions <script-extensions>`. In addition it is possible to run
scripts directly from :ref:`the console <script-console>`. All scripts share
a single JavaScript context.

.. _script-extensions:

Scripted Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extensions are placed in a system-specific location. This folder can be opened
from the Plugins tab in the :doc:`Preferences dialog </manual/preferences>`.

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Windows** | | :file:`C:/Users/<USER>/AppData/Local/Tiled/extensions/`       |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **macOS**   | | :file:`~/Library/Preferences/Tiled/extensions/`               |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Linux**   | | :file:`~/.config/tiled/extensions/`                           |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

An extension can be placed directly in the extensions directory, or in a
sub-directory. All scripts files found in these directories are executed on
startup.

.. note::

    If your scripts depend on other scripts that you want to include rather
    than have them execute directly, they can be nested in another
    sub-directory.

When any loaded script is changed, the script engine is reinstantiated and the
scripts are reloaded. This makes it quick to iterate on a script until it
works as intended.

Apart from scripts, extensions can include images that can be used as the icon
for scripted actions or tools.

.. _script-console:

Console View
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Console view (*View > Views and Toolbars > Console*) you will
find a text entry where you can write or paste scripts to evaluate them.

You can use the Up/Down keys to navigate through previously entered
script expressions.

.. _script-connecting-to-signals:

Connecting to Signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The script API provides signals to which functions can be connected.
Currently, the tiled module has the most useful :ref:`set of signals <script-tiled-signals>`.

Properties usually will have related signals which can be used to detect
changes to that property, but most of those are currently not
implemented.

To connect to a signal, call its ``connect`` function and pass in a
function object. In the following example, newly created maps
automatically get their first tile layer removed:

.. code:: js

    tiled.assetCreated.connect(function(asset) {
        if (asset.layerCount > 0) {
            asset.removeLayerAt(0)
            tiled.log("assetCreated: Removed automatically added tile layer.")
        }
    })

In some cases it will be necessary to later disconnect the function from
the signal again. This can be done by defining the function separately
and passing it into the ``disconnect`` function:

.. code:: js

    function onAssetCreated(asset) {
        // Do something...
    }

    tiled.assetCreated.connect(onAssetCreated)
    // ...
    tiled.assetCreated.disconnect(onAssetCreated)

API Reference
-------------

tiled module
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``tiled`` module is the main entry point and provides properties,
functions and signals which are documented below.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **version** : string |ro|, Currently used version of Tiled.
    **platform** : string |ro|, "Operating system. One of ``windows``, ``macos``, ``linux`` or ``unix``
    (for any other UNIX-like system)."
    **arch** : string |ro|, "Processor architecture. One of ``x64``, ``x86`` or ``unknown``."
    **actions** : [string] |ro|, "Available actions for :ref:`tiled.trigger() <script-trigger>`."
    **menus** : [string] |ro|, "Available menus for :ref:`tiled.extendMenu() <script-extendMenu>`."
    **activeAsset** : :ref:`script-asset`, "Currently selected asset, or ``null`` if no file is open. Can be assigned
    any open asset in order to change the active asset."
    **openAssets** : array |ro|, "List of currently opened :ref:`assets <script-asset>`."
    **mapEditor** : :ref:`script-mapeditor`, "Access the editor used when editing maps."
    **tilesetEditor** : :ref:`script-tileseteditor`, "Access the editor used when editing tilesets."

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

.. _script-trigger:

tiled.trigger(action : string) : void
    This function can be used to trigger any registered action. This
    includes most actions you would normally trigger through the menu or by
    using their shortcut.

    Use the ``tiled.actions`` property to get a list of all available actions.

    Actions that are checkable will toggle when triggered.

.. _script-execute:

tiled.executeCommand(name : string, inTerminal : bool) : void
    Executes the first custom command with the given name, as if it was
    triggered manually. Works also with commands that are not currently enabled.

    Raises a script error if the command is not found.

.. _script-open:

tiled.open(fileName : string) : :ref:`script-asset`
    Requests to open the asset with the given file name. Returns a reference to
    the opened asset, or ``null`` in case there was a problem.

.. _script-close:

tiled.close(asset : :ref:`script-asset`) : bool
    Closes the given asset without checking for unsaved changes (to confirm the
    loss of any unsaved changes, set ``activeAsset`` and trigger the "Close"
    action instead).

.. _script-reload:

tiled.reload(asset : :ref:`script-asset`) : :ref:`script-asset`
    Reloads the given asset from disk, without checking for unsaved changes.
    This invalidates the previous script reference to the asset, hence the new
    reference is returned for convenience. Returns ``null`` if reloading failed.

tiled.alert(text : string [, title : string]) : void
    Shows a modal warning dialog to the user with the given text and
    optional title.

tiled.confirm(text : string [, title : string]) : bool
    Shows a yes/no dialog to the user with the given text and optional
    title. Returns ``true`` or ``false``.

tiled.prompt(label : string [, text : string [, title : string]]) : string
    Shows a dialog that asks the user to enter some text, along with the
    given label and optional title. The optional ``text`` parameter provides
    the initial value of the text. Returns the entered text.

tiled.log(text : string) : void
    Outputs the given text in the Console window as regular text.

tiled.warn(text : string, activated : function) : void
    Outputs the given text in the Console window as warning message and creates
    an issue in the Issues window.

    When the issue is activated (with double-click or Enter key) the given
    callback function is invoked.

tiled.error(text : string, activated : function) : void
    Outputs the given text in the Console window as error message and creates
    an issue in the Issues window.

    When the issue is activated (with double-click or Enter key) the given
    callback function is invoked.

.. _script-registerAction:

tiled.registerAction(id : string, callback : function) : :ref:`script-action`
    Registers a new action with the given ``id`` and ``callback`` (which is
    called when the action is triggered). The returned action object can be
    used to set (and update) various properties of the action.

    Example:

    .. code:: javascript

        var action = tiled.registerAction("CustomAction", function(action) {
            tiled.log(action.text + " was " + (action.checked ? "checked" : "unchecked"))
        })

        action.text = "My Custom Action"
        action.checkable = true
        action.shortcut = "Ctrl+K"

    The shortcut will currently only work when the action is added to a menu
    using :ref:`tiled.extendMenu() <script-extendMenu>`.

.. _script-registerMapFormat:

tiled.registerMapFormat(shortName : string, mapFormat : object) : void
    Registers a new map format that can then be used to open and/or save maps
    in that format.

    If a map format is already registered with the same ``shortName``,
    the existing format is replaced. The short name can also be used to
    specify the format when using ``--export-map`` on the command-line,
    in case the file extension is ambiguous or a different one should be
    used.

    The ``mapFormat`` object is expected to have the following properties:

    .. csv-table::
        :widths: 1, 2

        **name** : string, Name of the format as shown in the file dialog.
        **extension** : string, The file extension used by the format.
        "**read** : function(fileName : string) : :ref:`script-map`", "A function
        that reads a map from the given file. Can use :ref:`TextFile <script-textfile>` or
        :ref:`BinaryFile <script-binaryfile>` to read the file."
        "**write** : function(map : :ref:`script-map`, fileName : string) : string | undefined", "A function
        that writes a map to the given file. Can use :ref:`TextFile <script-textfile>` or
        :ref:`BinaryFile <script-binaryfile>` to write the file. When a non-empty string is returned, it is shown as error message."
        "**outputFiles** : function(map : :ref:`script-map`, fileName : string) : [string]", "A function
        that returns the list of files that will be written when exporting the given map (optional)."

    Example that produces a simple JSON representation of a map:

    .. code:: javascript

        var customMapFormat = {
            name: "Custom map format",
            extension: "custom",

            write: function(map, fileName) {
                var m = {
                    width: map.width,
                    height: map.height,
                    layers: []
                };

                for (var i = 0; i < map.layerCount; ++i) {
                    var layer = map.layerAt(i);
                    if (layer.isTileLayer) {
                        var rows = [];
                        for (y = 0; y < layer.height; ++y) {
                            var row = [];
                            for (x = 0; x < layer.width; ++x)
                                row.push(layer.cellAt(x, y).tileId);
                            rows.push(row);
                        }
                        m.layers.push(rows);
                    }
                }

                var file = new TextFile(fileName, TextFile.WriteOnly);
                file.write(JSON.stringify(m));
                file.commit();
            },
        }

        tiled.registerMapFormat("custom", customMapFormat)

.. _script-registerTilesetFormat:

tiled.registerTilesetFormat(shortName : string, tilesetFormat : object) : void
    Like :ref:`registerMapFormat <script-registerMapFormat>`, but registers a
    custom tileset format instead.

    The ``tilesetFormat`` object is expected to have the following properties:

    .. csv-table::
        :widths: 1, 2

        **name** : string, Name of the format as shown in the file dialog.
        **extension** : string, The file extension used by the format.
        "**read** : function(fileName : string) : :ref:`script-tileset`", "A function
        that reads a tileset from the given file. Can use :ref:`TextFile <script-textfile>` or
        :ref:`BinaryFile <script-binaryfile>` to read the file."
        "**write** : function(tileset : :ref:`script-tileset`, fileName : string) : string | undefined", "A function
        that writes a tileset to the given file. Can use :ref:`TextFile <script-textfile>` or
        :ref:`BinaryFile <script-binaryfile>` to write the file. When a non-empty string is returned, it is shown as error message."

.. _script-registerTool:

tiled.registerTool(shortName : string, tool : object) : object
    Registers a custom tool that will become available on the Tools tool bar
    of the Map Editor.

    If a tool is already registered with the same ``shortName`` the existing
    tool is replaced.

    The ``tool`` object has the following properties:

    .. csv-table::
        :widths: 1, 2

        **name** : string, Name of the tool as shown on the tool bar.
        **map** : :ref:`script-map`, Currently active tile map.
        **selectedTile** : :ref:`script-tile`, The last clicked tile for the active map. See also the ``currentBrush`` property of :ref:`script-mapeditor`.
        **preview** : :ref:`script-map`, Get or set the preview for tile layer edits.
        **tilePosition** : :ref:`script-point`, Mouse cursor position in tile coordinates.
        **statusInfo** : string, Text shown in the status bar while the tool is active.
        **enabled** : bool, Whether this tool is enabled.
        "**activated** : function() : void", Called when the tool was activated.
        "**deactivated** : function() : void", Called when the tool was deactivated.
        "**keyPressed** : function(key, modifiers) : void", Called when a key was pressed while the tool was active.
        "**mouseEntered** : function() : void", Called when the mouse entered the map view.
        "**mouseLeft** : function() : void", Called when the mouse left the map view.
        "**mouseMoved** : function(x, y, modifiers) : void", Called when the mouse position in the map scene changed.
        "**mousePressed** : function(button, x, y, modifiers) : void", Called when a mouse button was pressed.
        "**mouseReleased** : function(button, x, y, modifers) : void", Called when a mouse button was released.
        "**mouseDoubleClicked** : function(button, x, y, modifiers) : void", Called when a mouse button was double-clicked.
        "**modifiersChanged** : function(modifiers) : void", Called when the active modifier keys changed.
        "**languageChanged** : function() : void", Called when the language was changed.
        "**mapChanged** : function(oldMap : :ref:`script-map`, newMap : :ref:`script-map`) : void", Called when the active map was changed.
        "**tilePositionChanged** : function() : void", Called when the hovered tile position changed.

        "**updateEnabledState** : function() : void", Called when the map or the current layer changed.

    Here is an example tool that places a rectangle each time the mouse has
    moved by 32 pixels:

    .. code:: javascript

        var tool = tiled.registerTool("PlaceRectangles", {
            name: "Place Rectangles",

            mouseMoved: function(x, y, modifiers) {
                if (!this.pressed)
                    return

                var dx = Math.abs(this.x - x)
                var dy = Math.abs(this.y - y)

                this.distance += Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
                this.x = x
                this.y = y

                if (this.distance > 32) {
                    var objectLayer = this.map.currentLayer

                    if (objectLayer && objectLayer.isObjectLayer) {
                        var object = new MapObject(++this.counter)
                        object.x = Math.min(this.lastX, x)
                        object.y = Math.min(this.lastY, y)
                        object.width = Math.abs(this.lastX - x)
                        object.height = Math.abs(this.lastY - y)
                        objectLayer.addObject(object)
                    }

                    this.distance = 0
                    this.lastX = x
                    this.lastY = y
                }
            },

            mousePressed: function(button, x, y, modifiers) {
                this.pressed = true
                this.x = x
                this.y = y
                this.distance = 0
                this.counter = 0
                this.lastX = x
                this.lastY = y
            },

            mouseReleased: function(button, x, y, modifiers) {
                this.pressed = false
            },
        })


.. _script-extendMenu:

tiled.extendMenu(id : string, items : array | object) : void
    Extends the menu with the given ID. Supports both a list of items or a
    single item. Available menu IDs can be obtained using the ``tiled.menus``
    property.

    A menu item is defined by an object with the following properties:

    .. csv-table::
        :widths: 1, 2

        **action** : string, ID of a registered action that the menu item will represent.
        **before** : string, ID of the action before which this menu item should be added (optional).
        **separator** : bool, Set to ``true`` if this item is a menu separator (optional).

    If a menu item does not include a ``before`` property, the value is
    inherited from the previous item. When this property is not set at all,
    the items are appended to the end of the menu.

    Example that adds a custom action to the "Edit" menu, before the "Select
    All" action and separated by a separator:

    .. code:: javascript

        tiled.extendMenu("Edit", [
            { action: "CustomAction", before: "SelectAll" },
            { separator: true }
        ]);

    The "CustomAction" will need to have been registered before using
    :ref:`tiled.registerAction() <script-registerAction>`.

.. _script-tiled-signals:

Signals
~~~~~~~

tiled.assetCreated(asset : :ref:`script-asset`)
    A new asset has been created.

tiled.assetOpened(asset : :ref:`script-asset`)
    An asset has been opened.

tiled.assetAboutToBeSaved(asset : :ref:`script-asset`)
    An asset is about to be saved. Can be used to make last-minute changes.

tiled.assetSaved(asset : :ref:`script-asset`)
    An asset has been saved.

tiled.assetAboutToBeClosed(asset : :ref:`script-asset`)
    An asset is about to be closed.

tiled.activeAssetChanged(asset : :ref:`script-asset`)
    The currently active asset has changed.


.. _script-object:

Object
^^^^^^

The base of most data types in Tiled. Provides the ability to associate custom
properties with the data.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **asset** : :ref:`script-asset` |ro|, "The asset this object is part of, or ``null``."
    **readOnly** : bool |ro|, Whether the object is read-only.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

.. _script-object-property:

Object.property(name : string) : variant
    Returns the value of the custom property with the given name, or
    ``undefined`` if no such property is set on the object.

    *Note:* Currently it is not possible to inspect the value of ``file`` properties.

.. _script-object-setProperty:

Object.setProperty(name : string, value : variant) : void
    Sets the value of the custom property with the given name. Supported types
    are ``bool``, ``number`` and ``string``. When setting a ``number``, the
    property type will be set to either ``int`` or ``float``, depending on
    whether it is a whole number.

    *Note:* Support for ``color`` and ``file`` properties is currently missing.

.. _script-object-properties:

Object.properties() : object
    Returns all custom properties set on this object. Modifications to the
    properties will not affect the original object.

.. _script-object-setProperties:

Object.setProperties(properties : object) : void
    Replaces all currently set custom properties with a new set of properties.

.. _script-object-removeProperty:

Object.removeProperty(name : string) : void
    Removes the custom property with the given name.

.. _script-asset:

Asset
^^^^^

Inherits :ref:`script-object`.

Represents any top-level data type that can be saved to a file. Currently
either a :ref:`script-map` or a :ref:`script-tileset`.

All modifications made to assets and their contained parts create undo
commands. This includes both modifying functions that are called as well as
simply assigning to a writable property.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **fileName** : string |ro|, File name of the asset.
    **modified** : bool |ro|, Whether the asset was modified after it was saved or loaded.
    **isTileMap** : bool |ro|, Whether the asset is a :ref:`script-map`.
    **isTileset** : bool |ro|, Whether the asset is a :ref:`script-tileset`.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

.. _script-asset-macro:

Asset.macro(text : string, callback : function) : value
    Creates a single undo command that wraps all changes applied to this asset
    by the given callback. Recommended to avoid spamming the undo stack with
    small steps that the user does not care about.

    Example function that changes visibility of multiple layers in one step:

    .. code:: javascript

        tileMap.macro((visible ? "Show" : "Hide") + " Selected Layers", function() {
            tileMap.selectedLayers.forEach(function(layer) {
                layer.visible = visible
            })
        })

    The returned value is whatever the callback function returned.

.. _script-map:

TileMap
^^^^^^^

Inherits :ref:`script-asset`.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **width** : int, Width of the map in tiles (only relevant for non-infinite maps).
    **height** : int, Height of the map in tiles (only relevant for non-infinite maps).
    **size** : :ref:`script-size` |ro|, Size of the map in tiles (only relevant for non-infinite maps).
    **tileWidth** : int, Tile width (used by tile layers).
    **tileHeight**: int, Tile height (used by tile layers).
    **infinite** : bool, Whether this map is infinite.
    **hexSideLength** : int, Length of the side of a hexagonal tile (used by tile layers on hexagonal maps).
    **staggerAxis** : :ref:`StaggerAxis <script-map-staggeraxis>`, "For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines which axis (X or Y) is staggered."
    **orientation** : :ref:`Orientation <script-map-orientation>`, "General map orientation"
    **renderOrder** : :ref:`RenderOrder <script-map-renderorder>`, "Tile rendering order (only implemented for orthogonal maps)"
    **staggerIndex** : :ref:`StaggerIndex <script-map-staggerindex>`, "For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines whether the even or odd indexes along the staggered axis are shifted."
    **backgroundColor** : color, Background color of the map.
    **layerDataFormat** : :ref:`LayerDataFormat <script-map-layerdataformat>`, "The format in which the layer data is stored, taken into account by TMX, JSON and Lua map formats."
    **layerCount** : int |ro|, Number of top-level layers the map has.
    **tilesets** : [:ref:`script-tileset`], "The list of tilesets referenced by this map. To determine which tilesets are actually used, call :ref:`usedTilesets() <script-map-usedTilesets>`."
    **selectedArea** : :ref:`SelectionArea <script-selectedarea>`, The selected area of tiles.
    **currentLayer** : :ref:`script-layer`, The current layer.

Note that while tile layers have a size, the size is generally ignored on
infinite maps. Even for fixed size maps, nothing in the scripting API stops you
from changing the layer outside of its boundaries and changing the size of the
layer has no effect on its contents. If you want to change the size while
affecting the contents, use the ``resize`` function.

    Returns the value of the cell at the given position. Can be used to query
    the flags and the tile ID, but does not currently allow getting a tile
    reference.

    **height** : int, Height of the rectangle.

.. _script-region:

region
~~~~~~

**Properties**

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **boundingRect** : :ref:`script-rect` |ro|, Bounding rectangle of the region.


.. _script-point:

point
~~~~~

``Qt.point(x, y)`` can be used to create a point object.

**Properties**

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **x** : number, X coordinate of the point.
    **y** : number, Y coordinate of the point.

.. _script-size:

size
~~~~

``Qt.size(width, height)`` can be used to create a size object.

**Properties**

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **width** : number, Width.
    **height** : number, Height.

.. _script-polygon:

Polygon
~~~~~~~

A polygon is not strictly a custom type. It is an array of objects that each
have an ``x`` and ``y`` property, representing the points of the polygon.

To modify the polygon of a :ref:`script-mapobject`, change or set up the
polygon array and then assign it to the object.

.. _script-tileterrains:

Terrains
~~~~~~~~

An object specifying the terrain for each corner of a tile:

.. csv-table::

    **topLeft** : :ref:`script-terrain`
    **topRight** : :ref:`script-terrain`
    **bottomLeft** : :ref:`script-terrain`
    **bottomRight** : :ref:`script-terrain`

.. _script-textfile:

TextFile
~~~~~~~~

The TextFile object is used to read and write files in text mode.

When using ``TextFile.WriteOnly``, you need to call ``commit()`` when you're
done writing otherwise the operation will be aborted without effect.

**Properties**

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **filePath** : string |ro|, "The path of the file."
    **atEof** : bool |ro|, "True if no mode data can be read."
    **codec** : string, "The text codec."

.. csv-table::
    :header: "TextFile.OpenMode"
    :widths: 1, 2

    TextFile.ReadOnly, 0x0001
    TextFile.WriteOnly, 0x0002
    TextFile.ReadWrite, TextFile.ReadOnly | TextFile.WriteOnly
    TextFile.Append

**Functions**

new TextFile(fileName : string [, mode : OpenMode = ReadOnly])
    Opens a text file in the given mode.

TextFile.readLine() : string
    Reads one line of text from the file and returns it. The returned string
    does not contain the newline characters.

TextFile.readAll() : string
    Reads all data from the file and returns it.

TextFile.truncate() : void
    Truncates the file, that is, gives it the size of zero, removing all
    content.

TextFile.write(text : string) : void
    Writes a string to the file.

TextFile.writeLine(text : string) : void
    Writes a string to the file and appends a newline character.

TextFile.commit() : void
    Commits all written text to disk. Should be called when writing to files in
    WriteOnly mode. Failing to call this function will result in cancelling the
    operation, unless safe writing to files is disabled.

TextFile.close() : void
    Closes the file. It is recommended to always call this function as soon as
    you are finished with the file.

.. _script-binaryfile:

BinaryFile
~~~~~~~~~~

The BinaryFile object is used to read and write files in binary mode.

When using ``BinaryFile.WriteOnly``, you need to call ``commit()`` when you're
done writing otherwise the operation will be aborted without effect.

**Properties**

.. csv-table::
    :widths: 1, 2

    **filePath** : string |ro|, "The path of the file."
    **atEof** : bool |ro|, "True if no mode data can be read."
    **size** : number, "The size of the file (in bytes)."
    **pos** : number, "The position that data is written to or read from."

.. csv-table::
    :header: "BinaryFile.OpenMode"
    :widths: 1, 2

    BinaryFile.ReadOnly, 0x0001
    BinaryFile.WriteOnly, 0x0002
    BinaryFile.ReadWrite, BinaryFile.ReadOnly | BinaryFile.WriteOnly

**Functions**

BinaryFile.resize(qint64 size) : void
    Sets the file size (in bytes). If size is larger than the file currently is,
    the new bytes will be set to 0; if size is smaller, the file is truncated.

BinaryFile.seek(qint64 pos) : void
    Sets the current position to *pos*.

BinaryFile.read(qint64 size) : ArrayBuffer
    Reads at most *size* bytes of data from the file and returns it as an
    ArrayBuffer.

BinaryFile.readAll() : ArrayBuffer
    Reads all data from the file and returns it as an ArrayBuffer.

BinaryFile.write(data : ArrayBuffer) : void
    Writes *data* into the file at the current position.

BinaryFile.commit() : void
    Commits all written data to disk. Should be called when writing to files in
    WriteOnly mode. Failing to call this function will result in cancelling the
    operation, unless safe writing to files is disabled.

BinaryFile.close() : void
    Closes the file. It is recommended to always call this function as soon as
    you are finished with the file.
