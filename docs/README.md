## Generating the Documentation

To generate the Tiled documentation, you need to install Python 3, Sphinx and
the ReadTheDocs theme.

On Ubuntu the following commands could be used:

    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip3 install sphinx
    pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme

Or, alternatively:

    sudo apt install python3-sphinx-rtd-theme

Then, the documentation can be generated by running:

    make html

## Updating Translation Files

The documentation can be translated as well. To update the translation files
before tagging a new release, the following commands can be used:

    make gettext
    sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l de -l fr

Above only German and French are included because they are hosted, but other
languages could be added in the future if there's enough interest in keeping
those translations up to date.
