msgid "Automapping is an advanced tool to automatically search certain combinations of tiles across layers in a map and to replace these parts with another combination. This allows the user to draw structures quickly and Automapping will generate a complex scenario from them, which would have taken much more time if manually crafted."

Using the different layers **regions\\_input** and **regions\\_output** delivers the possibility to have different regions for the input section and the output section. The region layer(s) are only used to mark regions where an Automapping rule exists.

As of now there also is a certain sequence within one rulemapfile. Generally speaking the regions with small y value come first. If there are regions at the same y value, then the x value is taken into account. On orthogonal maps this ordering scheme is the same as for reading in most western countries (Left to right, top to bottom). The order within one rulemap may be changed later, once tiled is capable of utilizing multiple threads/processors.

Tiled focuses on general flexibility while trying to stay intuitive.**"

A tileset can be either a single image containing many tiles, or it can be a collection of individual images. In order to support certain depth faking techniques, tiles and layers can be offset by a custom distance and their rendering order can be configured."

#: ../../manual/introduction.rst:20

In addition, there are several selection tools and a tool that does :doc:`automatic terrain transitions <terrain>`. Finally, it can apply changes based on :doc:`pattern-matching <automapping>` to automate parts of your work."

You can add rectangle, point, ellipse, polygon, polyline and tile objects. Object placement is not limited to the tile grid and objects can also be scaled or rotated. Object layers offer a lot of flexibility to add almost any information to your level that your game needs."
