msgid ""
"Automapping is an advanced tool to automatically search certain "
"combinations of tiles across layers in a map and to replace these parts "
"by other combination. This allows the user to draw structures with a "
"minimum of time spent and the Automapping will be able to generate a "
"rather complex scenario, which would need lots more time if manually "
"crafted."

"So the goal of Automapping is that you only need to draw within one layer"

#~ "Since defining the terrain information "

#~ " to use the external tilesets feature"
#~ " of Tiled to share not only the"
#~ " image but also the terrain "
#~ "information among several maps. Note "
#~ "however, that it is not possible "
#~ "to edit the terrain information while"
#~ " the tileset is external. To work "

#~ "Information dialog is currently not able"
#~ " to render the overlay correctly for"
#~ " isometric tiles. When defining terrain "
#~ "for isometric tiles, imagine the top-"
#~ "left corner applies to the top of"
#~ " your isometric tile, the top-right"
#~ " corner applies to the right corner"

#~ "it is not able to edit multiple"
