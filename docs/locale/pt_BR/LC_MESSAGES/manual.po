msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/automapping.rst:8
msgid "Automapping is an advanced tool to automatically search certain combinations of tiles across layers in a map and to replace these parts with another combination. This allows the user to draw structures quickly and Automapping will generate a complex scenario from them, which would have taken much more time if manually crafted."

msgid "The goal of Automapping is that you only need to draw within one layer and everything else is setup for you. This brings some advantages:"

Using the different layers **regions\\_input** and **regions\\_output** delivers the possibility to have different regions for the input section and the output section. The region layer(s) are only used to mark regions where an Automapping rule exists.

As of now there also is a certain sequence within one rulemapfile. Generally speaking the regions with small y value come first. If there are regions at the same y value, then the x value is taken into account. On orthogonal maps this ordering scheme is the same as for reading in most western countries (Left to right, top to bottom). The order within one rulemap may be changed later, once tiled is capable of utilizing multiple threads/processors.

One defines the edge and corner colors of tiles in a tileset. This information can then be used when filling, or brushing to allow for smooth, non-repetitive transitions between tiles. In most cases this tiling is random, and based on color probability. More info on Wang tiles can be found `here <https://web.archive.org/web/20230101/cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/intro.html>`_."
