<p>Another small bugfix release, fixing a potential crash and a host of smaller issues. The changelog:</p>             <ul>              <li>Fixed hit area for polygon nodes when editing polygons while zoomed in or out</li>              <li>Fixed another possible crash in the orthogonal renderer</li>              <li>Fixed Select All action to work for object layers</li>              <li>Fixed map pixel size preview for staggered maps</li>              <li>Fixed repainting issues when tiles extend beyond their layer boundaries</li>              <li>Fixed repainting issues when using tiles smaller than the grid size</li>              <li>Display errors non-modal when applying automatic automapping rules</li>              <li>Flare plugin: Fixed coordinate format for import and export (by Justin Jacobs)</li>              <li>Lua plugin: Write out Image layer position</li>              <li>Small updates to the Italian translation (by Omnomnobot)</li>            </ul> <p>Meanwhile, I'm making progress on adding support for <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1">hexagonal maps</a> and plan to release Tiled 0.11 as soon as this is complete. You can already try the support for "pointy topped" staggered hexagonal maps in the daily builds!</p> <p>Finally, there is now a <a href="http://discourse.mapeditor.org/">Tiled community forum</a>. I plan to post weekly development updates there and of course any other Tiled-related topics are welcome there too!</p>
