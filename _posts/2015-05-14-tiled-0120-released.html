<p>Please welcome the first community supported Tiled release! The main new feature in this release is the improved support for object resizing, including support for resizing polygons and tile objects. The time I needed to finalize the integration of this <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/593">pull request</a> and doing subsequent polishing was sponsored directly by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjorn?ty=p">my patrons</a>. I want to thank them all for their invaluable contributions! If you're using Tiled and want to help me spend more time on improving it, please consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjorn">becoming a patron</a>. Even a small amount is very appreciated!</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XgY5ezPENQc/VVUL2PecrWI/AAAAAAAAFZs/0HeRWgVqUJ8/s1600/-battle.tmx%2B-%2BTiled_010.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XgY5ezPENQc/VVUL2PecrWI/AAAAAAAAFZs/0HeRWgVqUJ8/s640/-battle.tmx%2B-%2BTiled_010.png" /></a></div> <p>There have been some smaller additions and bunch of fixes as well.
