<p>This is mostly a bug fixing release, adding only some minor things here and there. Notable changes include making sure the JSON format stores everything, fixing string quoting issues in the Lua export and allowing double-click on objects to open their properties dialog. And for those who like to have a lot of maps open at the same time, Tiled should now close a lot faster. Here's the full list of changes:</p>             <ul>            <li>Added saving of map background to JSON format (by Petr Viktorin)</li>            <li>Added saving of terrain information to JSON format (by Petr Viktorin)</li>            <li>Object Selection tool now always start selecting objects when holding Shift</li>            <li>Increased maximum for tileset margin and spacing to 9999</li>            <li>Some updates to libtiled-java (by Oskar Wiksten)</li>            <li>Install the automappingconverter application (relevant on Linux)</li>            <li>Avoid using Windows 95 style (was used on some Linux desktop environments)</li>            <li>Removed layer name checks from the Flare export plugin (by Stefan Beller)</li>            <li>Double-clicking an object now opens the Object Properties dialog</li>            <li>Fixed Object Properties dialog not remembering its size</li>            <li>Fixed object drawing order for image saving and mini-map</li>            <li>Fixed some plurals in English translation</li>            <li>Fixed line widths when zooming in Qt 5</li>            <li>Fixed updating of image layer when its opacity or image is changed</li>            <li>Fixed display of grid in tileset view on certain zoom levels</li>            <li>Fixed save in wrong format after opening a map with plugin (by Mike Hendricks)</li>            <li>Fixed closing Tiled being very slow with many maps</li>            <li>Fixed saving of image layer properties in the Lua format</li>            <li>Fixed escaping of special characters in the Lua format</li>            <li>Fixed handling of relative paths for image layers in the JSON plugin</li>            </ul> <p>Meanwhile, a lot of new features have already been added for the next feature release of Tiled. I have described some of them in the first <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-04-26-tiled-development-update %}">Tiled development update</a> and I plan to blog about some other new stuff soon. Don't be afraid to try a <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html">daily build</a>! Apart from being able to try the new features, it is also your chance of providing feedback before they enter a stable release.</p>
