<p>At long last there is a new feature release of Tiled! Ever since 0.8 was released new features have kept accumulating at pretty much the usual pace, so there is a lot of new stuff in this one. It's hard to pick favourites, so I'll only highlight a couple.</p> <p>Several new dockable windows have been added. There's now a file system view, an object list and a mini-map. These should really help navigating your ever growing world.</p> <p>Also, many improvements have been made to the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Automapping">automapping</a> system, which can now produce object layers and apply rules while editing. New in this area is the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Using-the-Terrain-Tool">terrain tool</a>, which really helps if its corner-based algorithm works with your tiles.</p> <p>Here follows the full list of changes:</p> <ul><li>Added objects dock and per-object visibility toggle (by Tim Baker)</li><li>Added maps dock (by Tim Baker)</li><li>Added terrain tool for automatic terrain transitions (by Manu Evans)</li><li>Added a minimap (by Christoph Schnackenberg)</li><li>Added a staggered isometric map renderer, still without object layer support</li><li>Added basic image layer support (by Gregory Nickonov and Alexander Kuhrt)</li><li>Added display of current layer to the status bar (by Tim Baker)</li><li>Added editable combo box for changing the zoom level (by Tim Baker)</li><li>Added support for multiple input layers to automapping (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added option to apply automapping rules while editing (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added a converter to update old automapping rules (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added support for objects layers to automapping (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added support for random mode to the fill tool (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added Replica Island plugin (by Eric Kidd)</li><li>Added option to change the grid color (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added support for ellipse objects (by devnewton and Christoph Schnackenberg)</li><li>Added name labels for objects on isometric maps (by Andrew Motrenko)</li><li>Added map property for changing the background color (by Emmanuel Barroga)</li><li>Added shortcut to manually reload tilesets (Ctrl-T) (by Michael Williams)</li><li>Added toggle for showing tile object outlines</li><li>Added support for pinch zooming (by Pierre-David Bélanger)</li><li>Added initial (non-GUI) support for individual and/or embedded tile images (by Petr Viktorin)</li><li>Added reading support to Flare plugin (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Added a TMX rasterizer command line tool (by Vincent Petithory)</li><li>Added man pages and desktop file (by Erik Schilling)</li><li>Made the size and position of most dialogs persistent</li><li>Respect the original layer data format of a loaded map (by Ben Longbons)</li><li>Marked Tiled as high-resolution capable on Mac OS X</li><li>Improved handling of external tilesets in Lua export</li><li>Reverted tilesets view back to tabs, but with menu button (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Allowed plugins to support multiple file name filters (by Samuli Tuomola)</li><li>Allow saving in any format that can also be read (by Stefan Beller)</li><li>Fixed eraser skipping tiles when moving fast</li><li>Fixed bug in Flare plugin (by Clint Bellanger)</li><li>Fixed compile against Qt 5 (by Kenney Phillis)</li><li>Fixed resolving of symbolic links while loading map</li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen after trying to load a faulty map</li><li>Updated Portuguese, Dutch, German, Spanish, Russian, French, Japanese, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, Hebrew and Czech translations (thanks to all translators!)</li></ul> <p>As evident by the above changelog, this release is the result of <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0">a record number of contributors</a> (a total of 33 since 0.8.1). A big thanks to everybody who opened pull requests and persisted through the code reviews!</p> <p>For authors of frameworks and libraries supporting the TMX format, I've summarized <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format#wiki-changelog">the additions</a> on the wiki.</p>
