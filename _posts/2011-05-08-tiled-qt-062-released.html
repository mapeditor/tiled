<p>This release fixes a few minor bugs reported by users. Since it didn't seem likely that much more fixes would accumulate, it was time to get them out there. The changes are:</p> <ul><li>Fixed object layers losing their color when resizing the map</li><li>Fixed the tabs in the Tilesets dock to use scroll buttons on MacOS X</li><li>Fixed window title to update when saving a map with a different name</li></ul> <p>The 0.7.0 release is expected to be still quite a bit off, but meanwhile you can already compile Tiled yourself from the git master branch to try out some of the new features. These include merging layers, copy & paste support for objects and various improvements to the support for running external commands. Maybe you could even try adding your own favorite feature to the list!</p>
