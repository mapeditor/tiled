<p>Tiled 0.5.1 is certainly late, and thus a number of requests have built up while we've been busy with other projects. It is a step closer to the stability we hope to achieve, and it adds some of the features that have been asked for.</p>    <ul>      <li>Added a checkerboard background to tileset palette</li>      <li>Added support for layer locking (not editable when locked)</li>      <li>Added support for tmx.gz map files</li>      <li>Added selection addition and substraction via Shift and Ctrl respectively</li>      <li>Improved the drawing speed thanks to some thorough testing and suggestions (Jerome Blouin)</li>      <li>Improved transformation so that it respects selections</li>      <li>Fixed the "Save As Image" feature to use current zoom level</li>      <li>Fixed drawing on invisible layers</li>      <li>Fixed selection rectangle to include one more tile</li>      <li>Fixed loading of plugins that only do export and no import</li>      <li>Fixed removing tilesets in the Tileset Manager</li>      <li>Fixed image loading to ensure hardware acceleration is used where possible in Java 1.4 and above (Jerome Blouin)</li>      <li>Fixed a NullPointerException when loading TSX files as imported tilesets</li>      <li>Fixed an "Unsupported protocol" error when loading TMX files which referenced an external tileset under certain conditions</li>      <li>Fixed a ClassCastException when loading GIFs as tilesets</li>    </ul>
