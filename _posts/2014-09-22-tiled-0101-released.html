This small upgrade is mandatory for anybody who's using the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Using-the-Terrain-Tool">Terrain tool</a>. It fixes a crash that was reported three times already since the 0.10.0 release. The full changelog:  <ul><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when using the Terrain tool</li><li>Fixed missing background color information from Lua export</li><li>Allow using up to 3 or 4 GB RAM on 32 or 64 bit Windows systems respectively</li></ul> In addition, there is now a <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/releases">64-bit Windows installer</a> available, for those who need to edit crazy huge maps!
