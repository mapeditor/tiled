<p>We've registered our own domain and moved our website from <a href="http://tiled.rpgdx.net/">http://tiled.rpgdx.net/</a> to our new location at <a href="http://mapeditor.org/">http://mapeditor.org/</a>. Be sure to update your bookmarks! ;-)</p>    <p>Recently there has been some progress towards a new Tiled release, which is expected to be released within a few weeks. Improvements will include bugfixes and internationalization. We also hope to include some new features, but unfortunately we are still rather short on time. Note that if you are using Tiled and would like to work on some improvements, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
