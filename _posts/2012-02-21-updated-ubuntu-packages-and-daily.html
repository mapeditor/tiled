<p>Thanks to the efforts of Erik Schilling, there are once again updated Tiled packages available for all recent versions of Ubuntu (or derivatives like Mint). Not only this, but the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mapeditor.org/+archive/tiled">new official PPA</a> also contains a <code>tiled-daily</code> package that is updated whenever changes are pushed into the repository.</p> <p>Actually <a href="http://files.mapeditor.org/daily/">daily builds for Windows</a> have been available since a long time, thanks to Stefan Beller. I've now added a link to these to the sidebar as well.</p> <p>If you want to see what's new in the daily builds, keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/commits/master">commit log</a> of the master branch, on which these builds are based.</p>
