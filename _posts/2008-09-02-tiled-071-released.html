<p>Shortly after we released Tiled 0.7.0, a number of issues were found. Some of them were pretty critical or meant basic functionality was broken, so I decided not to wait too long with making a new release. The changes:</p><ul><li>Added support for a margin around a tileset image</li><li>Improved the tileset manager and allow tileset reorganizing (by Jared Adams)</li><li>Fixed automatically adding extension to tileset Save As... dialog</li><li>Fixed saving/loading of layers with an origin other than 0,0</li><li>Fixed map resize to apply the offset to layers not matching the map bounds</li><li>Fixed loading of object group properties</li><li>Fixed duplicates of object groups to not share the objects</li><li>Fixed Lua export to increase firstgid of tilesets properly (by Jelle Geerts)</li><li>Fixed saving of property values that contain quotes</li><li>Fixed the state of menu actions when starting up without a map</li></ul>
