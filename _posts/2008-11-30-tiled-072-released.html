<p>Since a stable release of 0.8.0 could still take a while, I've decided to make another release with some fixes made since 0.7.1. The changes:</p><ul><li>Added support for associating an image with a map object</li><li>Fixed not being able to move an object group</li><li>Fixed unable to select small map objects (by Jared Adams)</li><li>Fixed references to external tilesets that are not in the same directory</li><li>Fixed some files missing from tiled-core.jar (by Jared Adams)</li><li>Updated The Mana World plugin to detect the collision layer correctly (by Jared Adams)</li><li>Updated minimum Java version to 1.5</li></ul>
