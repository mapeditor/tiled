<p>It came to my attention that some users were still using Tiled Qt 0.3.1 because of a regression in saving object position and size when the tile width is different from the tile height. Well, we can't have that so I've released 0.5.1 which fixes this issue. The Czech translation was also updated, thanks to Petr Viktorin!</p>
