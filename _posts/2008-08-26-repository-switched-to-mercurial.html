<p>After a two week testing period, the official source code repository has been switched over from Subversion to <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a>. This version control system is not much more complicated than Subversion, while offering a lot of advantages. If you've been following Tiled development using Subversion and have questions about <a href="http://hg.mapeditor.org/tiled">the new repository</a>, feel free to contact us!</p>
