Yes, this was a little embarrassing. But I'm just trying to make sure people have the best experience and unfortunately some pretty bad bugs were discovered after [Tiled 0.12][1] was released. Let's hope these were the last!

**Tiled 0.12.1**

* Fixed updating of map view when changing objects from properties view
* Fixed updating of Properties view while objects are moved/resized
* Fixed terrain information getting lost when reading JSON maps

**Tiled 0.12.2**

* Fixed updating of map view when moving objects with arrow keys
* Fixed compatibility issue with tile objects affecting the JSON format


Three of the above fixes were necessary as a result of a last-minute fix for another problem. That just shows once again that one can't be careful enough in the days right before the release...

In any case, enjoy Tiled 0.12.2!
