<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"></span>Things have been pretty quiet since the 0.7.2 release of Tiled. This was partly due to me working on a rewrite of Tiled, using Qt/C++. I now think this rewrite is complete enough for its first release, though compared to the Java version a lot of features are still missing. You'll find Tiled Qt 0.1.0 on in the Development section of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.<br /><br />I'm curious to hear how the Qt version works for you, and am looking forward to hear about everyones favourite missing feature. A&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/tiled/">new bug tracker</a>&nbsp;has been set up to keep track of your feedback. As always, feel free to email me directly or to write to the&nbsp;<a href="http://rpgdx.net/mailman/listinfo/tiled-user_rpgdx.net">tiled-user mailing list</a>.<br /><br />Finally, I'm looking for additional contributors! Are you familiar with C++ and Qt, or want to learn? Tiled is a relatively small and simple project, with a clean design. Any help is appreciated! :-)
