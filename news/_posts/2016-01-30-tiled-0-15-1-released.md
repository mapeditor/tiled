This is a small bugfix release with things that got reported and fixed this month, as well as an updated Czech translation. Enjoy!

* Fixed adding/removing object name labels when set to always visible ([#1171](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1171))
* [Fixed a problem with 'Execute in Terminal' on OS X](http://forum.mapeditor.org/t/unable-to-create-open-when-trying-to-execute-command-on-osx/998)
* [Fixed mouse coordinate conversion for hexagonal renderer](http://forum.mapeditor.org/t/tile-placement-off-cursor-on-hexmap/1019)
* Fixed image layer offset handling ([#1185](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1185))
* Updated Czech translation ([#1184](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/pull/1184))
