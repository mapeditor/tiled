<p>After a long pause, there's finally a new release of Tiled. We also released two tutorials on the website. Changes include:</p>    <ul>      <li>Configuration defaults to preset values, Tiled should now work fine if there is no initial config file</li>      <li>Layer rotation and flipping</li>      <li>Map resizing (warning: cannot be undone yet)</li>      <li>Custom properties on tiles and map</li>      <li>A file filter on loading and saving for .tmx and .tsx</li>      <li>Several UI improvements (usage of JSplitPane and JSpinner for example)</li>      <li>Small changes to the map format*</li>      <li>Implemented a better underlying architecture for Maps and Brushes</li>      <li>Fixed several null pointer exceptions</li>      <li>Added an Ant build target for tiled-core.jar, for use in Java engines</li>      <li>Support for other than 2:1 isometric tile ratios (2:1 and 1:1 tested)</li>      <li>Fixed redo for painting operations (paint, fill, erase)</li>      <li>Improved undo/redo of layer organisation changes</li>    </ul>    <p>*) Map width/height are now attributes of the map element instead of a seperate dimensions element. Also, Tiled now correctly wraps unencoded layer data in a data element.</p>
