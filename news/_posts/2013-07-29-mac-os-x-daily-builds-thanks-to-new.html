<p>Tiled <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/download">daily builds</a> have been available since a while for Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora and several other GNU/Linux distributions. Now there are daily builds available for Mac OS X as well!</p> <p>These builds have been made possible by  Steffen Itterheim from <a href="http://koboldkit.com/">Kobold Kit</a>, who sent me his Mac mini with a fresh install of Mac OS X 10.8. In addition he also  offered to host the builds on his server. A huge thanks to Steffen for this amazing contribution!</p> <p>Having access to a Mac of course has some other advantages as well. New releases will now always be available for OS X immediately, while before it would usually take a few days. Also, I should now be able to reproduce (and hopefully fix) issues that only happen on OS X.</p> <p>If you're a Mac OS X user who enjoys making maps with Tiled, be sure to check out Steffen's <a href="http://www.koboldtouch.com/">Kobold Touch</a> and <a href="http://koboldkit.com/">Kobold Kit</a> game engines. They integrate very well with Tiled and add new features based on custom properties like parallax scrolling and physics, and should be a quick way to get a headstart on your game.</p>
