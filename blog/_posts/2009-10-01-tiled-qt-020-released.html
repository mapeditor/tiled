<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"></span><br />This second release of the Qt version of Tiled is mainly trying to catch up with the Java version a bit, feature wise. Tiled Qt should now be fully usuable as a replacement of the Java version for basic orthogonal tile maps. The changes:<br /><ul><li>Added support for zooming the map view</li><li>Added an eraser tool that allows you to erase tiles</li><li>Added ability to save a map as an image</li><li>Added support for masking tileset images based on a certain color</li><li>Added a slider to change the opacity of the current layer</li><li>Fixed the minimum row and column size in the tileset view</li><li>Fixed stamp creation when not dragging topleft to bottomright</li></ul>Let me know when you're missing something, either via the&nbsp;<a href="http://rpgdx.net/mailman/listinfo/tiled-user_rpgdx.net">mailing list</a>&nbsp;or just post directly to the&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/tiled/">bug tracker</a>.
