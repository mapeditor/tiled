<div style='float: left; margin: 20px 15px 10px 0px;'><a class='zoom' href='http://images.mapeditor.org/itilemaps-screenshot.png'><img alt='iTileMaps, TMX tile map editor for iPad' height='184' src='http://images.mapeditor.org/itilemaps-screenshot-small.png' width='245'/></a></div> <p>A few days ago, Vsevolod Klementjev (KleMiX) released <a href="http://www.klemix.com/page/iTileMaps.aspx">iTileMaps</a> for iPad. Since quite a few of Tiled users are developing for iOS, this will be of interest to some of you.</p> <p>iTileMaps allows you to view and edit your tile maps on your iPad. Even though it's just the initial release, it already supports most features of the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format">TMX map format</a>, including editing of object layers and properties (see its website for a list of features as well as current limitations).</p> <p>The developer allowed me to try it out, and the main thing I noticed is that it runs very smooth. Also the interface looks pretty good. It's certainly not more efficient than editing the maps in Tiled (yet), but I think it has a good potential once there has been more time to learn what works and what doesn't for a touch based tile map editor.</p> <p>If you find this interesting, don't hesitate to support KleMiX by <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/itilemaps/id432784227">getting your copy</a>. He's also very open to feedback (just like me), so let him know how you think he could improve iTileMaps!</p>
