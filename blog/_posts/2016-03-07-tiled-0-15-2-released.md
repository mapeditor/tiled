This small patch release ships with added Turkish translation and an updated Brazilian Portuguese translation! There are also some fixes, though they are more on the cosmetic side.

* Added Turkish translation (by Nuri Uzunoğlu)
* Fixed hiding of object labels when deleting an object layer
* Fixed updating of object label colors when changing object types
* TMX: Added image size attributes to image layer images
* Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation (by Laete Meireles)

The [Tiled itch.io page](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) has been updated with the new download links.

In the meantime, many features have been added on the development branch during [January](http://forum.mapeditor.org/t/january-2016-development-updates/1033) and [February](http://forum.mapeditor.org/t/february-2016-development-updates/1104). And since [editing of external tilesets](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/242) is becoming a huge change, I plan to make a Tiled 0.16 release available in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!
