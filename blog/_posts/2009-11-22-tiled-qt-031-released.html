<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"></span><br />A few issues with the 0.3.0 release got reported, and this release is mostly about fixing those up. The list of changes:<br /><ul><li>Enabled undo command compression for stamp brush and eraser</li><li>Fixed reading of maps with non-binary-encoded layer data</li><li>Fixed a compile issue on Mac OS X related to QXmlStreamWriter</li><li>Fixed a crash when loading a map while holding Ctrl</li><li>Confirm overwrite on the right moment for 'Save as Image' dialog</li></ul>For the next release I'm working on support for isometric maps. Hopefully there will even be time to include support for hexagonal maps as well. Stay tuned!
