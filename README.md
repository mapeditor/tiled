About Tiled
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor for all tile-based games, such as
RPGs, platformers or Breakout clones.

Tiled is highly flexible. It can be used to create maps of any size, with no
restrictions on tile size, or the number of layers or tiles that can be used.
Maps, layers, tiles, and objects can all be assigned arbitrary properties.
Tiled's map format (TMX) is easy to understand and allows multiple tilesets to
be used in any map. Tilesets can be modified at any time.

Installing Tiled
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tiled is available for all major operating systems and can be downloaded either
from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/releases) or from
[itch.io](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled). Most Linux distributions also
package Tiled, but these packages are usually out of date so you might prefer
to use the AppImage or install Tiled through
[Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/org.mapeditor.Tiled) or
[snap](https://snapcraft.io/tiled), both of which are official releases.

### Signed Releases for macOS and Windows

macOS builds are signed by the maintainer, ThorbjÃ¸rn Lindeijer, who registered
as Apple Developer.

Windows installers are using free code signing provided by
[SignPath.io](https://signpath.io?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=tiled),
and a free code signing certificate by the
[SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=tiled).

Compiling Tiled
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you can compile Tiled, you must ensure the Qt (>= 5.12) development
libraries have been installed as well as the Qbs build tool:

* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qtbase5-private-dev libqt5svg5-dev qttools5-dev-tools zlib1g-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtdeclarative5-private-dev qbs`
* On Fedora:        `sudo dnf builddep tiled`
* On Arch Linux:    `sudo pacman -S qt qt5-tools qbs`
* On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  + `brew install qbs` (which automatically pulls in `qt`)

If you want to build the Python plugin, you additionally need to install the
Python 3 development libraries:

* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3-dev`
* On Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Alternatively, you can [download Qt here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer).
You will still need to install a development environment alongside and some
libraries depending on your system, for example:

* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`
* On Windows:       Choose "MinGW" Qt version, or install Visual Studio
* On macOS:         Install Xcode

The easiest way to compile and run Tiled is to open `tiled.qbs` in Qt Creator
and run the project from there.

From the command-line, you may need to set up Qbs before you can build Tiled
(you will also need to make sure the version of Qt you want to use is in your
path):

    qbs setup-toolchains --detect     # setup toolchains
    qbs setup-qt --detect             # setup Qt (not needed since Qbs 1.13)
    qbs                               # build Tiled

You can now run Tiled as follows:

    qbs run -p tiled

### Qt 6

For compiling libtiledquick (not built by default) you'll need to install the
Vulkan headers:

* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libvulkan-dev`

### Working with Visual Studio 2017

Once Qbs is set up (see previous instructions), it is possible to generate a
Visual Studio 2017 project with it that allows you to code, compile and run
using that IDE. This can be done with the following command:

    qbs generate -g visualstudio2017

Installing Self-Compiled Tiled
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Tiled, run `qbs install` from the terminal. By default, Tiled will
be installed to `<build-dir>/install-root`.

The installation prefix can be changed when building Tiled. For example, to use
an installation prefix of  `/usr`:

    qbs qbs.installPrefix:"/usr"

To install Tiled to a packaging directory:

    qbs install --install-root /tmp/tiled-pkg

By default, Tiled and its plugins are compiled with an Rpath that allows them
to find the shared *libtiled* library immediately after being compiled. When
packaging Tiled for distribution, the Rpath should be disabled by appending
`projects.Tiled.useRPaths:false` to the qbs command.
